# Lean UX is an evolution, not a revolution.
### Architectures based on UX-UI for Web|Desktop|Mobile
If you want to build a great house, the person to call is the architect. We all know this, but architecture can be applied not only to traditional buildings but also information space. Similar to buildings, information should be structured with a solid foundation. Understanding the basic principles of good information architecture is essential for any designer who creates products for people.
